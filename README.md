# Aboard Rules

Aboard is a platform that allows anyone to create content for either personal, private or public use. When a space or any content within a space is shared publicly, users of Aboard must adhere to the Aboard Rules.

To maintain a safe and welcoming environment for a wide range of people to engage in the platform, we prohibit certain conduct.

Each user of Aboard is responsible for maintaining these standards.

In deciding whether someone has violated the rules, we will take into account things like the context and nature of the shared information, the likelihood and severity of actual or potential harm, and applicable laws.

Violations of our rules may result in consequences such as account restrictions and suspension of your account. Aboard has the sole authority and final decision as to whether content or behavior violates our rules.

If you find content on Aboard that you believe violates these rules, please report it by emailing us at feedback@aboard.com.

### Threats of violence and incitement

We do not allow content or actions that threaten, encourage, or incite violence against anyone, directly or indirectly.

### Hateful content

We do not allow content that constitutes or promotes violence, harassment, or hatred against people based on characteristics like race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, caste, disability, disease, age, sexual orientation, gender, or gender identity.

We do not allow posts or accounts that glorify, celebrate, downplay, or trivialize violence, suffering, abuse, or deaths of individuals or groups. This includes the use of scientific or pseudoscientific claims or misleading statistics to pathologize, dehumanize, or disempower others.

### If you break the rules

We strive to be fair, but we reserve the right to suspend accounts or remove content, without notice, for any reason, particularly to protect our services, infrastructure, users, or community. If you attempt to evade suspension by creating new accounts or posts, we will suspend your new accounts and posts.

### Notice

Upon investigating or disabling content associated with your account, we will notify you, unless we believe your account is automated or operating in bad faith, or that notifying you is likely to cause, maintain or exacerbate harm to someone.

### Government Takedown Requests

If Aboard receives a request from a government actor to restrict access to content associated with your account, we will notify you unless we are prohibited by law or believe doing so may endanger others. 

We may enforce, or not enforce, these policies at our sole discretion. These policies don’t create a duty or contractual obligation for us to act.

We also may change these rules at any time. We track changes to our rules on GitHub so you can see how they evolve.
